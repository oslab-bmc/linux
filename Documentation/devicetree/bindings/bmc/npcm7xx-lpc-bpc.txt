Nuvoton NPCM7xx LPC BPC interface

Nuvoton BMC NPCM7xx BIOS Post Code (BPC) monitoring two
configurable I/O addresses written by the host on the
Low Pin Count (LPC) bus, the capure data stored in 128-word FIFO.

NPCM7xx BPC supports capture double words, when using capture
double word only I/O address 1 is monitored.

Required properties for lpc_bpc node
- compatible	: "nuvoton,npcm750-lpc-bpc" for Poleg NPCM7XX.
- reg 			: specifies physical base address and size of the registers.
- interrupts	: contain the LPC BPC with flags for falling edge.
- monitor-ports : contain monitor I/O addresses, at least one monitor I/O
				  address required

Optional property for lpc_bpc node
- bpc-en-dwcapture : enable capture double words support.

Example:
	lpc_bpc: lpc-bpc@f0007040 {
		compatible = "nuvoton,npcm7xx-lpc-bpc";
		reg = <0xf0007040 0x14>;
		monitor-ports = <0x80>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 9 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
