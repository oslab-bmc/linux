Nuvoton NPCM7XX 10/100 Ethernet MAC Controller (EMC)

The NPCM750x provides two identical Ethernet MAC Controllers
for WAN/LAN applications

Required properties:
- device_type     : Should be "network"
- compatible      : "nuvoton,npcm750-emc" for Poleg NPCM750.
- reg             : Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts      : Contain the emc interrupts with flags for falling edge.
                    first interrupt dedicated to Txirq
                    second interrupt dedicated to Rxirq
- phy-mode        : Should be "rmii" (see ethernet.txt in the same directory)
- clocks          : phandle of emc reference clock.
- use-ncsi        : Use the NC-SI stack instead of an MDIO PHY

Example:

emc0: eth@f0825000 {
	device_type = "network";
	compatible = "nuvoton,npcm750-emc";
	reg = <0xf0825000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
	             <GIC_SPI 15 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	phy-mode = "rmii";
	clocks = <&clk NPCM7XX_CLK_AHB>;

	#use-ncsi; /* add this to support ncsi */

	clock-names = "clk_emc";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&r1_pins
	             &r1err_pins
	             &r1md_pins>;
	status = "okay";
};
